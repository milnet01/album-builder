## ✅ v0.1.0 — Phase 1: Foundation (2026-04-27)

Themed PyQt6 window scans `Tracks/`, displays the library list with full metadata, installable via `.desktop`. No albums, playback, lyrics, export, or report yet — those land in Phases 2–4.

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ Project skeleton, venv, ruff config, pytest config
- ✅ Atomic-write helper (`atomic_write_text` / `atomic_write_bytes`)
- ✅ `Track` dataclass with mutagen ID3 parsing
- ✅ `Library` with scan / search / sort
- ✅ Dark + colourful theme (`Palette` + `qt_stylesheet`)
- ✅ `LibraryPane` widget (sortable, filterable QTableView)
- ✅ `MainWindow` with three-pane splitter
- ✅ Single-instance launcher via `QSharedMemory`
- ✅ Vinyl SVG icon + freedesktop `.desktop` template
- ✅ Per-user installer / uninstaller / README
- ✅ 30-test pytest suite (TDD throughout)

**Tag:** `v0.1.0-phase1` (local; not pushed)

## 🔥 Cross-cutting findings from `/indie-review` (2026-04-27)

3-lane multi-agent independent review. Same-mental-model blind spots caught by ≥2 reviewers.

- ✅ **Theme 1 — Spec drift.** All 5 instances closed by Tier 1 + Tier 2 fixes (hardcoded Tracks path, `album_artist` filter scope, default sort, PermissionError propagation, JPEG covers).
- ✅ **Theme 2 — Defensive-handler breadth.** `Library.scan` `OSError` catch narrowed (Tier 1.3); `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` `2>/dev/null` removed from cache-refresh tools — real failures now surface to the user.
- ✅ **Theme 3 — Single source of truth violations.** Version string consolidated to `version.py:__version__` (Tier 1.2 fold-in); icon path now resolves through `QIcon.fromTheme("album-builder")` — same theme name the `.desktop` file uses — with a dev-tree SVG fallback for running pre-install.

**Methodology gap (deferred to Phase 2 prep):** add a "Test contract" section to per-feature specs naming the clauses each test must validate. The implementation pipeline `spec → plan → code → tests` currently lets tests encode the plan's interpretation rather than the spec's contract. Tracked as a Phase 2 prep task; not blocking Phase 2 implementation work.

## 🔒 Tier 1 — ship-this-week fixes (security / data-loss / DoS)

✅ **All 4 landed 2026-04-28** on branch `feature/phase-1-foundation`. 47/47 tests pass; ruff clean. Net diff: +194 LOC across `app.py`, `track.py`, `library.py`, `library_pane.py`; +1 new module `persistence/settings.py`; +17 new tests.

- ✅ **CRITICAL — QSharedMemory stale-lock recovery + QLocalServer raise handshake.** `src/album_builder/app.py`. `attach()/detach()` recovery dance before `create(1)` reclaims orphan SHM segments left by SIGKILL/OOM/power-loss. `QLocalServer` listens on the same key; second-launch sends `raise\n` via `QLocalSocket` and exits silently. Previous "Already running" dialog removed. Commit `36afe6b`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `_resolve_tracks_dir()` consults settings.json first.** `src/album_builder/app.py`. New `persistence.settings` module is XDG-aware (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honored). Dev path is the labelled fallback with stderr warning so a misconfigured install is loud. Commit `ad0496b`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `Library.scan` surfaces real I/O errors.** `src/album_builder/domain/track.py`. New `_open_tags` helper unwraps OSError from MutagenError; PermissionError now propagates instead of silently dropping the file. Commit `cbeca8e`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `LibraryPane` filter includes `album_artist`.** `src/album_builder/ui/library_pane.py`. New `TrackFilterProxy` subclass overrides `filterAcceptsRow` to consult the underlying Track's `SEARCH_FIELDS`, matching domain `Library.search()` semantics. Commit `87ec172`.

## 🔒 Tier 2 — hardening sweep (correctness)

✅ **All 7 landed 2026-04-28** (6 from this sweep + 1 free fix folded into Tier 1.2). 57/57 tests pass; ruff + shellcheck clean.

- ✅ **HIGH — Three-way version split.** `src/album_builder/app.py` now imports `__version__` from `album_builder.version` (commit `ad0496b`, folded into Tier 1.2 since the file was already being touched).
- ✅ **HIGH — install.sh Python version check uses the wrong interpreter.** Now uses `"$PY"` consistently for both version read AND comparison; tuple compare via `sys.version_info >= (3, 11)`. Commit `a7dc745`.
- ✅ **HIGH — Non-deterministic COMM/USLT frame selection.** New `_pick_localised()` helper in `track.py` prefers `lang == "eng"` and falls back to the first non-empty other language. Empty English frames no longer shadow populated alternatives. Commit `cd829d4`.
- ✅ **HIGH — JPEG covers silently dropped.** Field renamed `cover_png → cover_data` + new `cover_mime`. `_first_apic_image()` accepts any `image/*` MIME (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF). Spec 01 updated. Commit `cd829d4`.
- ✅ **HIGH — WCAG AA contrast failure on placeholder text.** New `text_placeholder` palette token at `#9a9da8` (6.4:1 vs `bg_pane`). New `QLabel#PlaceholderText` QSS rule replaces inline `setStyleSheet`. Test asserts ratio via WCAG 2.2 luminance formula. Commit `b632264`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `TrackTableModel.data()` no row-bounds guard.** Explicit `if index.row() >= len(self._tracks): return None` after the validity check; stale proxy indices no longer crash via `IndexError` into Qt's C++ slot dispatch. Commit `b54466d`.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — No default sort applied at construction.** `LibraryPane.__init__` now calls `sortByColumn(0, AscendingOrder)`. Commit `b54466d`.

## ⚡ Tier 3 — structural / cosmetic

✅ **Sweep complete 2026-04-28.** 11 fixes landed; 2 carried forward (Phase 4 prep + intentional INFO defer). 65/65 tests pass; ruff + shellcheck clean.

- ✅ **MEDIUM — `pgrep` regex tightened.** `python[0-9.]*` matches `python`, `python3`, `python3.11`, `python3.13` — but not `pythonista` or random binaries.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `.desktop` Exec= dead `%F` removed.** App doesn't parse argv files; the field was a Phase-1 placeholder.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — install.sh swallows cache-refresh errors.** `2>/dev/null` removed; `|| true` preserved. Folded into Theme 2 sweep.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Focus ring 2px outline.** New `QPushButton:focus`, `QTableView:focus`, `QLineEdit:focus` rules with `2px solid accent_primary_1`. Padding compensated to avoid layout shift.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Library pane column resize policy.** Title=Stretch, all others=Interactive with sensible default widths (140/160/140/70 px). Min table width 420 px.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `Library.tracks` is now `tuple[Track, ...]`.** `__post_init__` coerces incoming iterables; Library is hashable; mutation through the frozen boundary blocked.
- ✅ **LOW — `cover_data` rename + spec sync.** Resolved by Tier 2.D (rename `cover_png → cover_data`/`cover_mime` + accept any `image/*` MIME). Spec 01 already updated.
- ✅ **LOW — Tmp filename collision.** `_unique_tmp_path()` suffixes with PID + 8 hex chars of `uuid4`. Concurrent Phase-2 debounce writers no longer collide.
- ✅ **LOW — `[[ $PURGE -eq 0 ]] && echo …` brittleness.** Converted to `if`-block; `set -e` safe.
- ✅ **LOW — `Library.search()` doesn't filter `is_missing`.** Carried forward into Phase 2 deliverables (only meaningful once `is_missing` is reachable post-rescan).
- ✅ **LOW — QScrollBar QSS styling.** Dark-theme scrollbars: `bg_pane` track, `border_strong` → `text_tertiary`-on-hover handle, 5px radius, no arrow buttons.
- ✅ **LOW — Splitter ratios.** `[500, 350, 550]` → `[5, 3, 5]` — HiDPI-friendly.
- 📋 **LOW — README WeasyPrint system-deps.** Genuinely Phase 4 prep (no WeasyPrint dependency until then). Add when `requirements.txt` pulls it in.
- 📋 **INFO — `track_at()` only used by tests.** Phase 2 will use it for click-to-play row → Track resolution. Keep.

## 🔭 Upcoming phases

### 🚧 v0.2.0 — Phase 2: Albums (planned)

Phase 2 lands the entire album state machine + service layer + UI on top of Phase 1's library. Specs: **02** (lifecycle), **03** (switcher), **04** (selection + target counter), **05** (drag-reorder), **10** (full schema-versioning framework + per-key debounce + state.json), **11** (palette tokens + glyph anchors used by the new widgets), and Spec 01 Phase-2-deferred items (`tracks_changed` + `QFileSystemWatcher`).

**Deliverables (mirror of `docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md` Tasks 1–18):**

- Domain — `Album` dataclass + `AlbumStatus` + state machine (create, rename, select, deselect, set_target, reorder, approve, unapprove); `slug` helper with collision resolver.
- Persistence — schema-version migration runner (`migrate_forward`); `album.json` (de)serialization with self-heal; `state.json` AppState round-trip; `DebouncedWriter` (250 ms per-key idle); ISO-8601 ms-precision Z-suffix encoding helper.
- Services — `AlbumStore` (Qt-aware CRUD + signals + `.trash` backup + service-level `approve` / `unapprove`); `LibraryWatcher` (closes TC-01-P2-01..04).
- UI — `TargetCounter` widget; `AlbumSwitcher` pill dropdown; `AlbumOrderPane` (middle pane drag-reorder); `LibraryPane` extensions (selection toggle column + at-target disable + accent strip); `TopBar` (composes switcher + name editor + counter + approve/reopen); `MainWindow` wire-up + state restore + close-flush.
- Release — bump 0.1.0 → 0.2.0; ROADMAP close-out.

Two TCs explicitly Phase-4-deferred: TC-02-13 (export-pipeline regen on approve) and TC-02-19 (export-pipeline crash-injection idempotence). Phase 2's `AlbumStore.approve()` writes the `.approved` marker + flips status only.

Plan: [`docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md`](docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md) (~3700 lines, 18 tasks, ready to execute).

### 📋 v0.3.0 — Phase 3: Playback & Lyrics (planned)

`QMediaPlayer` integration, transport controls, scrolling karaoke lyrics with Whisper-aligned `.lrc` cache. Specs: 06, 07.

### 📋 v0.4.0 — Phase 4: Export & Approval (planned)

M3U + symlink folder per album, hard-lock approval state, PDF + HTML report generation via WeasyPrint. Specs: 08, 09.

### 📋 Future / deferred

- Group-by-artist tabs (Spec 00 roadmap)
- Tap-along LRC editor for manual alignment correction
- Multi-project (multiple Tracks/ folders open at once)
- Album cover compositing
- Bulk pre-alignment scheduler
- Light-theme support / themable palette
- Recursive subfolder scanning under Tracks/

*Last reviewed: 2026-04-28 — Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 sweeps landed (cross-cutting Themes 1/2/3 closed); `/debt-sweep` triaged 7 findings (5 trivial fixed inline, 2 behavioural — `tracks_changed` deferred to Phase 2, missing-tags placeholder test added). 2 Tier-3 items intentionally carried forward (README WeasyPrint deps for Phase 4 prep; `track_at()` Phase 2 use confirmed). Phase 1 is feature-complete and hardened.*

*Round-1 spec sweep landed 2026-04-28 (32 issues across all 13 specs: schema-ownership canonicalised to Spec 10, approve-with-missing contradiction resolved, Specs 06–12 received TC-NN-MM IDs at speccing time, global keyboard-shortcuts table added to Spec 00, canonical approve sequence pinned in Spec 09, Spec 11 §Glyphs added to single-source `⋮⋮ ▲▼ ●○ 🔒 ✓ ▶ ⏸` etc.). Round-2 sweep landed 2026-04-28 (28 follow-ups: timestamp-encoding precision pin, atomic-write-tmp-strategy alignment, plan timestamp helper, approve/unapprove side-effect ordering, plan TC crosswalk extended to TC-10/TC-11/TC-01-P2). Round-3 sweep landed 2026-04-28 (15 follow-ups: state-diagram terminology, splitter ratios on save, glyph literals in widgets, approved-album badge, rename self-collision, UTC normalisation, TC-10-09 + TC-10-20 strengthened, delete emit order). Round-4 confirmation pass 2026-04-28 verified all fixes landed cleanly with 0 surviving HIGH issues and 0 new contradictions. **Documentation set is implementation-ready for Phase 2.**
