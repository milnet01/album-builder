# Album Builder — Roadmap

Working roadmap for the Album Builder app. Tracks completed phases, in-flight findings, and upcoming work.

- **Specs:** `docs/specs/` (one per feature)
- **Plans:** `docs/plans/` (one per phase)
- **Status markers:** 📋 pending · 🚧 in progress · ✅ done

---

## ✅ v0.1.0 — Phase 1: Foundation (2026-04-27)

Themed PyQt6 window scans `Tracks/`, displays the library list with full metadata, installable via `.desktop`. No albums, playback, lyrics, export, or report yet — those land in Phases 2–4.

**Deliverables:**

- ✅ Project skeleton, venv, ruff config, pytest config
- ✅ Atomic-write helper (`atomic_write_text` / `atomic_write_bytes`)
- ✅ `Track` dataclass with mutagen ID3 parsing
- ✅ `Library` with scan / search / sort
- ✅ Dark + colourful theme (`Palette` + `qt_stylesheet`)
- ✅ `LibraryPane` widget (sortable, filterable QTableView)
- ✅ `MainWindow` with three-pane splitter
- ✅ Single-instance launcher via `QSharedMemory`
- ✅ Vinyl SVG icon + freedesktop `.desktop` template
- ✅ Per-user installer / uninstaller / README
- ✅ 30-test pytest suite (TDD throughout)

**Tag:** `v0.1.0-phase1` (local; not pushed)

## 🔥 Cross-cutting findings from `/indie-review` (2026-04-27)

3-lane multi-agent independent review. Same-mental-model blind spots caught by ≥2 reviewers.

- ✅ **Theme 1 — Spec drift.** All 5 instances closed by Tier 1 + Tier 2 fixes (hardcoded Tracks path, `album_artist` filter scope, default sort, PermissionError propagation, JPEG covers).
- ✅ **Theme 2 — Defensive-handler breadth.** `Library.scan` `OSError` catch narrowed (Tier 1.3); `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` `2>/dev/null` removed from cache-refresh tools — real failures now surface to the user.
- ✅ **Theme 3 — Single source of truth violations.** Version string consolidated to `version.py:__version__` (Tier 1.2 fold-in); icon path now resolves through `QIcon.fromTheme("album-builder")` — same theme name the `.desktop` file uses — with a dev-tree SVG fallback for running pre-install.

**Methodology gap (deferred to Phase 2 prep):** add a "Test contract" section to per-feature specs naming the clauses each test must validate. The implementation pipeline `spec → plan → code → tests` currently lets tests encode the plan's interpretation rather than the spec's contract. Tracked as a Phase 2 prep task; not blocking Phase 2 implementation work.

---

## 🔒 Tier 1 — ship-this-week fixes (security / data-loss / DoS)

✅ **All 4 landed 2026-04-28** on branch `feature/phase-1-foundation`. 47/47 tests pass; ruff clean. Net diff: +194 LOC across `app.py`, `track.py`, `library.py`, `library_pane.py`; +1 new module `persistence/settings.py`; +17 new tests.

- ✅ **CRITICAL — QSharedMemory stale-lock recovery + QLocalServer raise handshake.** `src/album_builder/app.py`. `attach()/detach()` recovery dance before `create(1)` reclaims orphan SHM segments left by SIGKILL/OOM/power-loss. `QLocalServer` listens on the same key; second-launch sends `raise\n` via `QLocalSocket` and exits silently. Previous "Already running" dialog removed. Commit `36afe6b`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `_resolve_tracks_dir()` consults settings.json first.** `src/album_builder/app.py`. New `persistence.settings` module is XDG-aware (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` honored). Dev path is the labelled fallback with stderr warning so a misconfigured install is loud. Commit `ad0496b`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `Library.scan` surfaces real I/O errors.** `src/album_builder/domain/track.py`. New `_open_tags` helper unwraps OSError from MutagenError; PermissionError now propagates instead of silently dropping the file. Commit `cbeca8e`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `LibraryPane` filter includes `album_artist`.** `src/album_builder/ui/library_pane.py`. New `TrackFilterProxy` subclass overrides `filterAcceptsRow` to consult the underlying Track's `SEARCH_FIELDS`, matching domain `Library.search()` semantics. Commit `87ec172`.

## 🔒 Tier 2 — hardening sweep (correctness)

✅ **All 7 landed 2026-04-28** (6 from this sweep + 1 free fix folded into Tier 1.2). 57/57 tests pass; ruff + shellcheck clean.

- ✅ **HIGH — Three-way version split.** `src/album_builder/app.py` now imports `__version__` from `album_builder.version` (commit `ad0496b`, folded into Tier 1.2 since the file was already being touched).
- ✅ **HIGH — install.sh Python version check uses the wrong interpreter.** Now uses `"$PY"` consistently for both version read AND comparison; tuple compare via `sys.version_info >= (3, 11)`. Commit `a7dc745`.
- ✅ **HIGH — Non-deterministic COMM/USLT frame selection.** New `_pick_localised()` helper in `track.py` prefers `lang == "eng"` and falls back to the first non-empty other language. Empty English frames no longer shadow populated alternatives. Commit `cd829d4`.
- ✅ **HIGH — JPEG covers silently dropped.** Field renamed `cover_png → cover_data` + new `cover_mime`. `_first_apic_image()` accepts any `image/*` MIME (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF). Spec 01 updated. Commit `cd829d4`.
- ✅ **HIGH — WCAG AA contrast failure on placeholder text.** New `text_placeholder` palette token at `#9a9da8` (6.4:1 vs `bg_pane`). New `QLabel#PlaceholderText` QSS rule replaces inline `setStyleSheet`. Test asserts ratio via WCAG 2.2 luminance formula. Commit `b632264`.
- ✅ **HIGH — `TrackTableModel.data()` no row-bounds guard.** Explicit `if index.row() >= len(self._tracks): return None` after the validity check; stale proxy indices no longer crash via `IndexError` into Qt's C++ slot dispatch. Commit `b54466d`.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — No default sort applied at construction.** `LibraryPane.__init__` now calls `sortByColumn(0, AscendingOrder)`. Commit `b54466d`.

## ⚡ Tier 3 — structural / cosmetic

✅ **Sweep complete 2026-04-28.** 11 fixes landed; 2 carried forward (Phase 4 prep + intentional INFO defer). 65/65 tests pass; ruff + shellcheck clean.

- ✅ **MEDIUM — `pgrep` regex tightened.** `python[0-9.]*` matches `python`, `python3`, `python3.11`, `python3.13` — but not `pythonista` or random binaries.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `.desktop` Exec= dead `%F` removed.** App doesn't parse argv files; the field was a Phase-1 placeholder.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — install.sh swallows cache-refresh errors.** `2>/dev/null` removed; `|| true` preserved. Folded into Theme 2 sweep.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Focus ring 2px outline.** New `QPushButton:focus`, `QTableView:focus`, `QLineEdit:focus` rules with `2px solid accent_primary_1`. Padding compensated to avoid layout shift.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Library pane column resize policy.** Title=Stretch, all others=Interactive with sensible default widths (140/160/140/70 px). Min table width 420 px.
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `Library.tracks` is now `tuple[Track, ...]`.** `__post_init__` coerces incoming iterables; Library is hashable; mutation through the frozen boundary blocked.
- ✅ **LOW — `cover_data` rename + spec sync.** Resolved by Tier 2.D (rename `cover_png → cover_data`/`cover_mime` + accept any `image/*` MIME). Spec 01 already updated.
- ✅ **LOW — Tmp filename collision.** `_unique_tmp_path()` suffixes with PID + 8 hex chars of `uuid4`. Concurrent Phase-2 debounce writers no longer collide.
- ✅ **LOW — `[[ $PURGE -eq 0 ]] && echo …` brittleness.** Converted to `if`-block; `set -e` safe.
- ✅ **LOW — `Library.search()` doesn't filter `is_missing`.** Carried forward into Phase 2 deliverables (only meaningful once `is_missing` is reachable post-rescan).
- ✅ **LOW — QScrollBar QSS styling.** Dark-theme scrollbars: `bg_pane` track, `border_strong` → `text_tertiary`-on-hover handle, 5px radius, no arrow buttons.
- ✅ **LOW — Splitter ratios.** `[500, 350, 550]` → `[5, 3, 5]` — HiDPI-friendly.
- 📋 **LOW — README WeasyPrint system-deps.** Genuinely Phase 4 prep (no WeasyPrint dependency until then). Add when `requirements.txt` pulls it in.
- 📋 **INFO — `track_at()` only used by tests.** Phase 2 will use it for click-to-play row → Track resolution. Keep.

---

## ✅ v0.2.0 — Phase 2: Albums (2026-04-28)

Phase 2 lands the entire album state machine + service layer + UI on top of Phase 1's library. Specs: **02** (lifecycle), **03** (switcher), **04** (selection + target counter), **05** (drag-reorder), **10** (full schema-versioning framework + per-key debounce + state.json), **11** (palette tokens + glyph anchors used by the new widgets), and Spec 01 TC-01-P2-01..02 (`tracks_changed` + `QFileSystemWatcher` watcher mechanism).

**Shipped (Tasks 1–18 from `docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md`):**

- Domain — `Album` dataclass + `AlbumStatus` + state machine (create, rename, select, deselect, set_target, reorder, approve, unapprove); `slug` helper with collision resolver.
- Persistence — schema-version migration runner (`migrate_forward`); `album.json` (de)serialization with self-heal (relative-path resolve, target-vs-count bump, marker/status reconcile); `state.json` AppState round-trip with corrupt/too-new fallback; `DebouncedWriter` (250 ms per-key idle); ISO-8601 ms-precision Z-suffix encoding helper.
- Services — `AlbumStore` (Qt-aware CRUD + signals + `.trash` backup + service-level `approve` / `unapprove`); `LibraryWatcher` wraps `QFileSystemWatcher` with 200 ms debounce.
- UI — `TargetCounter` widget; `AlbumSwitcher` pill dropdown (stackable ✓/🔒 prefixes); `AlbumOrderPane` (middle pane drag-reorder via `QListWidget.InternalMove`); `LibraryPane` extensions (selection toggle column + at-target disable + accent strip with primary/warning variants); `TopBar` (composes switcher + name editor + counter + approve/reopen); `MainWindow` fully wired with state restore + close-flush + window-resize/move state-save.
- Release — bumped 0.1.0 → 0.2.0; ROADMAP close-out.

Two TCs explicitly Phase-4-deferred: TC-02-13 (export-pipeline regen on approve) and TC-02-19 (export-pipeline crash-injection idempotence). Phase 2's `AlbumStore.approve()` writes the `.approved` marker + flips status only.

Spec 01 deferral correction: TC-01-P2-03 (Track.is_missing on file-removed) and TC-01-P2-04 (Library.search filter parameter) remain deferred — they require diffing successive scans + a search() kwarg. Spec 01 was updated to reflect this honestly rather than claim full TC-01-P2-01..04 coverage.

**Test contract:** all 79 TCs in the plan crosswalk are mapped to direct/indirect/deferred coverage. Final test count: 171 passing (up from 86 at end of Phase 1).

Plan: [`docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md`](docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md) (~3700 lines, 18 tasks, all complete).

## ✅ v0.2.1 — Phase 2 hardening (2026-04-28)

Patch release closing the `/indie-review` Tier 1 + Tier 2 fix queue. Same-day follow-up to v0.2.0; no user-facing feature changes. The detailed fix breakdown lives in the per-tier sections below.

**Shipped (34 items across 13 commits):**

- **Tier 1 (6 ship-now items):** `AlbumStore.delete()` crash-atomicity + sub-second trash precision; `closeEvent` step-isolated try/except; CLAUDE.md rewrite; README v0.2.0 status; Phase-2-plan crosswalk truthfulness for TC-01-P2-03/04.
- **Tier 2 (28 hardening items):** Domain invariants + per-entry OSError; JSON self-heal symmetry + state.json field-type guards + `Path.absolute()` symlink preservation; atomic-write parent fsync + `DebouncedWriter` exception guard + XDG absolute-path conformance; cross-FS trash warning + parent-folder watcher + dotfile-skip; UI a11y (keyboard activation, AccessibleTextRole, accessible names, approved tooltip); locale-aware sort; pill empty-state middle dot; counter empty-snap-to-1; setMaxLength→commit-time validation; SHM-error-class distinction + try/finally; window-geometry restore clamp; spec coherence sweep (Spec 12 `%F`, Spec 04 boundary, Spec 00 keyboard wiring status, Spec 01 watcher ownership).

**Test count:** 173 → 195 passing (+22 regression tests). Ruff clean. `/audit` clean across all 7 tools.

Three items intentionally deferred to v0.3.0:
- `LibraryPane._model._toggle_enabled` direct access (refactor → public accessor on `TrackTableModel`).
- `ACCENT_ROLE = Qt.UserRole + 2` magic-number → module constant.
- 17 Tier 3 structural / cosmetic items (gradients, refactors, perf, doc nits — better grouped with Phase 3 work).

One item accepted as v1 acceptance: stale-segment-recovery TOCTOU (microsecond race window during owner shutdown; documented in code).

## 🔥 Cross-cutting findings from `/indie-review` (2026-04-28)

8-lane multi-agent independent review (7 code lanes + 1 documentation lane). Same-mental-model blind spots caught by ≥2 reviewers. Author-bias flagged: parent session authored all of Phase 2; mitigation = fresh-context subagents widening external specs cited.

- 📋 **Theme A — Empty-state pill text drift.** `album_switcher.py:91` ships `▾ No albums + New album`; Spec 03 §user-visible behaviour line 21 + TC-03-06 require `▾ No albums · + New album` (middle dot U+00B7). ASCII-source-cleanup dropped the separator. Caught by L6-H1 + L8-L4.
- 📋 **Theme B — `settings.json` 8-field schema is fictional.** `persistence/settings.py` reads only `tracks_folder`. Spec 10 §`settings.json` schema (lines 189-216) documents `albums_folder`, `audio.{volume,muted}`, `alignment.{auto_align_on_play,model_size}`, `ui.{theme,open_report_folder_on_approve}`, plus `schema_version`. Either implement or mark spec as v1=tracks_folder-only. Caught by L3-M5 + L8-H5.
- 📋 **Theme C — `.bak` file requirement unimplemented.** Spec 10 line 79 + TC-10-03 require `<file>.v<old>.bak` on schema migration. `persistence/schema.py` is pure compute, no I/O. Latent until v2 schema lands; ship-blocker once it does. Caught by L2-M2 + L8-H4.
- 📋 **Theme D — Approve-button + AlbumPill QSS gradients absent.** Spec 11 §Gradients line 38 + TC-11-08 + Spec 03 §Visual rules line 90 specify `success → success-dark` / `accent-primary-1 → accent-primary-2` `qlineargradient` calls. `theme.py` contains zero gradient declarations. Caught by L6-M2 + L8-M4.
- 📋 **Theme E — Keyboard shortcuts not wired.** Spec 00 §Keyboard shortcuts (lines 119-129) lists Ctrl+N / Ctrl+Q / F1 + Phase-3 Space / arrows / M. `grep -rn "QShortcut\|setShortcut" src/` returns nothing. Spec implies Phase 1-2 shortcuts wired-now, Phase 3 deferred. Caught by L5-H3 + L7-L4 + L8-M5.
- 📋 **Theme F — Screen-reader / a11y labels missing across all widgets.** No `setAccessibleName` / `setAccessibleDescription` / `AccessibleTextRole` anywhere in `src/album_builder/ui/`. Toggle column reads as "black circle / white circle" to Orca. WCAG 2.2 §2.1.1 (keyboard) + §4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) fail. Caught by L5-H3 / H4 / H5 + L6-L12.
- 📋 **Theme G — Locale-aware sort missing.** `library_pane.py:108` returns raw `value` for sort role; AlbumStore uses `name.lower()`. Spec 00 §"Sort order (canonical)" line 65 says case-insensitive locale-aware. Polish "ł", Turkish dotted I, German "ß" sort wrong; Z < a (ASCII). Caught by L1 (noted) + L5-H1 + L8-M6.
- 📋 **Theme H — TC-01-P2-03/04 plan-crosswalk lies about coverage.** `docs/plans/2026-04-28-phase-2-albums.md:3683-3684` marks both "direct"; the named tests (`test_tracks_changed_fires_on_file_removed`, `test_watcher_survives_folder_deletion_and_recreation`) don't assert what the TCs say (`Track.is_missing=True`, `Library.search(include_missing=)` parameter). Spec 01 + ROADMAP correctly say "deferred"; the plan crosswalk is wrong. Caught by L1 (noted) + L8-H2.

---

## 🔒 Tier 1 — Phase 2 ship-now fixes (data-loss / blocking / doc-blast-radius)

✅ **All 6 landed 2026-04-28.** 3 surviving Criticals + 3 high-impact docs after threat-model calibration; single-user desktop threat model demoted SHM-leak-on-exception (L7-C2) to MEDIUM and CSRF-class to LOW. 173/173 tests pass; ruff clean.

- ✅ **CRITICAL — `AlbumStore.delete()` not crash-atomic.** Reordered to move-then-mutate at `src/album_builder/services/album_store.py:114-128`; failed `shutil.move` now leaves the album recoverable. Regression test in `test_album_store.py` monkeypatches the move to raise. Commit `a497943`. (L4-C1)
- ✅ **CRITICAL — Same-second `.trash` collision silently overwrites.** Switched to `%Y%m%d-%H%M%S-%f` (microseconds, UTC) at `album_store.py:124`. Regression test exercises delete-recreate-delete same-name same-second cycle. Commit `a497943`. (L4-C2)
- ✅ **CRITICAL — `closeEvent` flush is not exception-safe.** Each step wrapped in try/except with `logger.exception` at `main_window.py:217-228`. Regression test monkeypatches `store.flush` to raise; asserts state.json still receives new geometry. Commit `ac6ecbe`. (L7-C1)
- ✅ **CRITICAL — Project `CLAUDE.md` total rewrite.** Now describes the actual album-builder PyQt6 project (4-layer architecture, build/test/lint commands, conventions, applicable slash commands). Replaces the wholly-wrong "not a code project" declaration. Commit `941a5c3`. (L8-C1)
- ✅ **HIGH — README v0.2.0 status update.** Status section now describes shipped Phase 2 features (album CRUD, drag-reorder, target counter, watcher, debounced state.json) and clarifies playback → Phase 3 / export → Phase 4. Commit `053893f`. (L8-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — Phase-2-plan crosswalk TC-01-P2-03/04 honesty.** Both rows flipped from "direct" to "deferred" matching Spec 01 + ROADMAP. Inline notes explain why the cited tests don't actually assert the spec contract (`is_missing` semantics + `include_missing` filter). Commit `e2eeeaa`. (L8-H2)

## 🔒 Tier 2 — Phase 2 hardening sweep (correctness, pre-v0.3.0)

✅ **All 28 landed 2026-04-28** across 7 commits. 195/195 tests pass; ruff clean. Two MEDIUM items intentionally deferred to Tier 3 (`LibraryPane` direct `_model` access — refactor; `ACCENT_ROLE` constant — naming-only).

**Domain (L1):**

- ✅ **HIGH — `Library.scan` per-entry `OSError` unhandled.** `src/album_builder/domain/library.py:51` now wraps the per-entry `is_file()` + `suffix` access in try/except; stale-NFS or permission-denied entries skip the entry instead of aborting the whole scan. Commit `6744d42`. (L1-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — `Album.approve` missing-track check delegated, not documented.** Domain method's docstring now names `AlbumStore.approve()` as the precondition's owner; future direct callers must replicate the FileNotFoundError check or accept the risk. Commit `6744d42`. (L1-H2)
- ✅ **HIGH — `Album.__post_init__` invariant absent.** Now enforces 1≤target_count≤99, target_count≥len(track_paths), and "approved → non-empty selection". `_deserialize` pre-bumps target_count BEFORE construction so the existing TC-04-09 self-heal flow still works. Three new domain tests. Commit `6744d42`. (L1-H3)

**Persistence — JSON (L2):**

- ✅ **HIGH — `save_album_for_unapprove` ordering enforcement.** Now asserts `not (folder/"reports").exists()` before unlinking the marker; Phase 4 export-pipeline integration must delete reports/ first. Commit `4c5a562`. (L2-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — Self-heal "approved-without-marker" skips `save_album()`.** Now routes through `save_album` for symmetry with the marker-present-status-draft branch; `updated_at` bumps on the heal. Commit `4c5a562`. (L2-H2)
- ✅ **HIGH — `_deserialize` uses `Path.resolve()` not `Path.absolute()`.** Switched to `Path.absolute()` so user-supplied symlinks survive the relative→absolute heal. Commit `4c5a562`. (L2-H3)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `state_io.load_state` rewrite-on-corrupt.** Corrupt JSON now triggers an immediate rewrite with defaults (TC-10-12). New regression test. Commit `4c5a562`. (L2-M3)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `state_io.load_state` field-type guards.** Per-field `_coerce_uuid` / `_coerce_path` / `_coerce_window` helpers catch malformed UUID, junk window types, stray keys; falls back to defaults instead of raising past the load_state guard. Commit `4c5a562`. (L2-M4)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Self-heal `target_count` upper-bound clamp.** `_deserialize` pre-bumps target_count via `max(raw_target, len(resolved_paths))`; the new `Album.__post_init__` invariant catches >99 corruption at construction. Commit `4c5a562` + `6744d42`. (L2-M5)

**Persistence — write infra (L3):**

- ✅ **HIGH — `atomic_write_text` parent-dir fsync.** New `_fsync_dir` helper called after `os.replace` in both atomic-write helpers; best-effort (swallows EINVAL/ENOTSUP on filesystems without directory-fsync support). Commit `c997729`. (L3-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — `DebouncedWriter._fire` callback lacks exception guard.** Wrapped in try/except + `logger.exception` so disk-full mid-callback no longer silently drops the write. Regression test schedules a raising callback + survivor. Commit `c997729`. (L3-H4)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` relative-path acceptance.** `settings.settings_dir` rejects relative + empty values per the freedesktop Base Dir Spec; falls back to `~/.config/album-builder`. Two regression tests. Commit `c997729`. (L3-M3)
- 📋 **LOW (deferred to Tier 3) — `DebouncedWriter._timers` unbounded growth.** Bounded by album count today; revisit when high-cardinality keys land. (L3-M4)

**Services (L4):**

- ✅ **HIGH — Cross-FS `shutil.move` for `.trash` not asserted.** `AlbumStore.__init__` now compares `st_dev` of `Albums/` and `.trash` (when both exist) and warns on mismatch. Commit `0255943`. (L4-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — `datetime.now()` in trash stamp is local time.** Already fixed in Tier 1 (commit `a497943`) — `datetime.now(UTC).strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S-%f")`. (L4-H2)
- ✅ **HIGH — `rescan()` race assumption undocumented.** Docstring now pins the single-threaded-Qt-event-loop assumption + adds defensive `except Exception` so a future loader bug doesn't abort startup. Commit `0255943`. (L4-H3)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `LibraryWatcher.fileChanged` is dead code.** Connection dropped; comment explains the design choice. Commit `0255943`. (L4-M1)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `LibraryWatcher` doesn't watch parent for folder-recreate.** `_rebind_watch` now adds the parent folder to the watcher; folder-delete-then-recreate cycle (TC-01-P2-04) recovers without manual `refresh()`. Commit `0255943`. (L4-M2)

**UI — lists/tables (L5):**

- ✅ **HIGH — `_toggle` column header sortable would crash.** Sort role for `_toggle` now returns a `(selected, casefolded-name)` tuple; header click no longer raises AttributeError. Commit `236456b`. (L5-H2)
- ✅ **HIGH — Toggle column not keyboard-reachable.** `QTableView.activated` connected to the click handler; Enter/Return on a focused toggle cell triggers the toggle. WCAG 2.2 §2.1.1. Commit `236456b`. (L5-H3)
- ✅ **HIGH — Toggle column has no `AccessibleTextRole`.** Branch in `data()` returns `"selected: <title>"` / `"not selected: <title>"`. WCAG 2.2 §4.1.2. Regression test. Commit `236456b`. (L5-H4)
- ✅ **HIGH — Drag has no reduced-motion / accessible feedback.** `AlbumOrderPane.list.setAccessibleName` + `setAccessibleDescription`; LibraryPane likewise. Commit `236456b`. (L5-H5)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Approved-album tooltip absent.** `ToolTipRole` branch on the toggle cell of an APPROVED album returns the spec'd tooltip. Regression test. Commit `236456b`. (L5-M1)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `_rerender_after_move` text-mangle fragility.** Now reconstructs from a cached title (`UserRole+3 / TITLE_ROLE`) rather than splitting display text on `". "`. Titles containing ". " (e.g. "Mr. Brightside") survive. Regression test. Commit `236456b`. (L5-M2)
- ✅ **HIGH — Sort role returns raw value, not `casefold()`.** Now `value.casefold() if isinstance(value, str) else value`. Spec 00 §"Sort order (canonical)". Regression test. Commit `236456b`. (L5-H1)

**UI — top-bar (L6):**

- ✅ **HIGH — Empty-state pill text middle dot.** Restored to `▾ No albums · + New album` per Spec 03 line 21 + TC-03-06. Commit `ced2923`. (L6-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — `set_current(None)` initial-emit suppressed.** Docstring now documents the "no emit on construction; caller must seed" contract. MainWindow already seeds correctly. Commit `ced2923`. (L6-H2)
- ✅ **HIGH — `TargetCounter` empty-string commit reverts.** Empty now snaps to `MIN_TARGET` (TC-04-12); non-integer reverts via try/except `int()` (handles negative signs, Unicode digit forms). Commit `ced2923`. (L6-H4)
- ✅ **HIGH — `setMaxLength(80)` is UTF-16 code units.** Dropped; validation moved to commit time and uses `len(text) > 80` (code points) matching domain. Emoji-rich names no longer truncated. Commit `ced2923`. (L6-H5)
- 📋 **LOW (deferred to Tier 3) — `LibraryPane._model._toggle_enabled` direct access.** Naming-convention violation; refactor adds `is_toggle_enabled(row)` accessor. Tier 3. (L6-M1)
- 📋 **LOW (deferred to Tier 3) — `ACCENT_ROLE` magic number.** Define module constant; mirror to MISSING_ROLE shape. Tier 3. (L6-M2)

**App integration (L7):**

- ✅ **HIGH — `_save_state_now` magic constant `13`.** Extracted `SPLITTER_RATIO_TOTAL = 13` module constant. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-H1)
- ✅ **HIGH — `DEFAULT_TRACKS_DIR` developer absolute path.** Now gated behind `ALBUM_BUILDER_DEV_MODE=1` env OR `pyproject.toml` colocated with the running script. Installed user no longer silently picks the dev path. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-H2)
- ✅ **HIGH — `signal_raise_existing_instance` silent timeout.** `RAISE_TIMEOUT_MS` 500 → 2000 ms; logs to stderr on timeout so a busy peer surfaces a diagnostic. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-H3)
- ✅ **HIGH — `start_raise_server` calls `removeServer` unconditionally.** Docstring now documents the lock-holder-only precondition that justifies the unconditional removeServer. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-H4)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `acquire_single_instance_lock` doesn't distinguish error classes.** Inspects `lock.error()`; logs to stderr on non-`AlreadyExists` failures. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-M2)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — SHM detach + server.close not in `finally`.** `app.exec()` wrapped in try/finally. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-M3)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Window geometry restore not bounds-checked.** `max(400, w) / max(300, h) / max(0, x|y)` clamp on restore. Commit `8aa06d5`. (L7-L1)
- 📋 **LOW (accepted as v1) — Stale-segment recovery TOCTOU.** Microsecond race window during owner shutdown; documented in code as v1 acceptance. (L7-M1)

**Documentation (L8):**

- ✅ **HIGH — Spec 12 + `.desktop.in` `Exec=` drift.** Spec updated to match `Exec=@@LAUNCHER@@` (no `%F`); inline note explains the omission. Commit `ce37096`. (L8-H3)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — `set_current` ValueError vs MainWindow ad-hoc check.** Spec 03 TC-03-09 row now documents the lookup-first approach as canonical. Commit `ce37096`. (L8-M1)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Phase 2 plan crosswalk missing TC-12-NN.** Crosswalk now has TC-12-01..05 (direct, Phase 1) + TC-12-06..09 (manual smoke). Commit `ce37096`. (L8-M2)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Spec 04 `selected == target` boundary wording.** Now explicit: at-target is valid; `set_target(n)` accepts `n == selected_count`. Commit `ce37096`. (L8-M4)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Spec 00 keyboard-shortcut table claims Phase-1-2 shortcuts wired.** Added "Wired?" column; all marked "Phase 3" (focus-suppression machinery groups with Spec 06 work). Commit `ce37096`. (L8-M5)
- ✅ **MEDIUM — Spec 01 `tracks_changed` ownership.** Spec line 37 now correctly attributes the signal to `LibraryWatcher`, not `Library`. Commit `ce37096`. (L8-M6)

## ⚡ Tier 3 — Phase 2 structural / cosmetic

📋 **Lower-priority items: a11y polish, refactors, perf, docs nits.**

- 📋 **MEDIUM — Locale-aware sort.** Spec 00 §Sort order; `library_pane.py:108` returns raw value; AlbumStore uses `name.lower()`. Use `casefold()` + locale collation. (Theme G fix.) Affects `library_pane.py` + `album_store.py`.
- 📋 **MEDIUM — Approve / pill QSS gradients.** Theme D fix: add `qlineargradient(...)` rules in `theme.py` for `QPushButton#ApproveButton` (Spec 11 §Gradients) and `QPushButton#AlbumPill` (Spec 03 §Visual rules). Set `objectName` on the buttons.
- 📋 **MEDIUM — `Library.search` lowercased-cache.** `domain/library.py:74-81` re-lowercases per keystroke. For 500-track tier (spec-stated cap), pre-compute a search-tuple cached property on `Track`. One-liner if you already touch this code.
- 📋 **MEDIUM — `slugify` non-ASCII transliteration.** `domain/slug.py:22-24`. "Émile" / "東京" all → `"album"` and collide en masse. Consider `unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", ...) + ASCII-encode` before fallback. Spec extension call.
- 📋 **MEDIUM — `Album.unapprove` doesn't re-validate target invariant.** Domain method; relies on approve-side guard. Defensive `assert` would close the gap.
- 📋 **MEDIUM — `_to_iso` naive-datetime guard.** `persistence/album_io.py:39`. Naive `datetime` interpreted as local time; future caller could feed one in and silently get wrong-hour stamps with `Z` suffix. Add `if dt.tzinfo is None: raise`.
- 📋 **LOW — Refactor `atomic_write_text` / `atomic_write_bytes` shared core.** `persistence/atomic_io.py`. Two 14-line functions could be 4 + 4-line wrappers. Rule of Three with the upcoming Phase-4 PDF write path.
- 📋 **LOW — Refactor three `save_album*` post-write blocks.** `persistence/album_io.py:104-116, 119-131, 134-150`. Extract `_write_album_json(folder, album)` for the common dump+atomic+ms-snap; the variants differ only on marker timing.
- 📋 **LOW — `read_text()` without explicit encoding.** `persistence/album_io.py:158`, `state_io.py:59`. Spec 10 says UTF-8, no BOM. Locale could produce ASCII default on stripped server. Pin `encoding="utf-8"`.
- 📋 **LOW — `cover_override` no relative-path heal.** `persistence/album_io.py:69, 89`. Spec 10 §Paths lists `cover_override` with same self-heal as track_paths; not applied.
- 📋 **LOW — `Library.scan` `casefold()` not `.lower()`.** `domain/library.py:91`. `.lower()` differs from `casefold()` only for German "ß" + a few others; near-miss not bug.
- 📋 **LOW — Approve dialog string mentions "Phase 4".** `src/album_builder/ui/main_window.py:131`. End user has no context for the phase reference. Rewrite to user-neutral language.
- 📋 **LOW — `AlbumStore` signal type comment vs `pyqtSignal(object)`.** `services/album_store.py:29-32`. Spec 03 documents typed signatures; idiom is `pyqtSignal(object)` with `# Album` comment. One-line clarifying note.
- 📋 **LOW — `LibraryPane.set_tracks` resets `_toggle_enabled` but not `_selected_paths`.** `ui/library_pane.py:39-43`. Stale selection survives. Either clear or document the contract.
- 📋 **LOW — `_format_duration` banker's rounding.** `ui/library_pane.py:113`. `round()` is half-to-even; user-readable durations want classic rounding.
- 📋 **LOW — `Albums/__pycache__/` produces noisy warning.** `services/album_store.py:52-54`. Filter rejects it via `AlbumDirCorrupt: missing album.json`. Skip dotfile/dunder dirs silently.
- 📋 **LOW — Empty-state pill text middle dot.** Theme A fix; `ui/album_switcher.py:91`.
- 📋 **LOW — DRAG_HANDLE rendering depends on font.** `ui/theme.py:184-200` `"⋮⋮"` is two adjacent vertical-ellipsis; Spec 11 says "stacked." Document or implement vertically.
- 📋 **INFO — Tests don't cite WCAG / RFC / TC-* in filenames.** `tests/ui/` filenames mirror module names; coverage map lives in spec only. Acceptable; flagged for awareness.
- 📋 **INFO — No structured logging anywhere in `persistence/`.** Spec 10 says "log warning" multiple times; modules silently swallow corrupt JSON / missing settings keys. One `import logging; logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` per module would close the gap.

*Last reviewed: 2026-04-28 — Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 sweeps landed (cross-cutting Themes 1/2/3 closed); `/debt-sweep` triaged 7 findings (5 trivial fixed inline, 2 behavioural — `tracks_changed` deferred to Phase 2, missing-tags placeholder test added). 2 Tier-3 items intentionally carried forward (README WeasyPrint deps for Phase 4 prep; `track_at()` Phase 2 use confirmed). Phase 1 is feature-complete and hardened.*

*Round-1 spec sweep landed 2026-04-28 (32 issues across all 13 specs: schema-ownership canonicalised to Spec 10, approve-with-missing contradiction resolved, Specs 06–12 received TC-NN-MM IDs at speccing time, global keyboard-shortcuts table added to Spec 00, canonical approve sequence pinned in Spec 09, Spec 11 §Glyphs added to single-source `⋮⋮ ▲▼ ●○ 🔒 ✓ ▶ ⏸` etc.). Round-2 sweep landed 2026-04-28 (28 follow-ups: timestamp-encoding precision pin, atomic-write-tmp-strategy alignment, plan timestamp helper, approve/unapprove side-effect ordering, plan TC crosswalk extended to TC-10/TC-11/TC-01-P2). Round-3 sweep landed 2026-04-28 (15 follow-ups: state-diagram terminology, splitter ratios on save, glyph literals in widgets, approved-album badge, rename self-collision, UTC normalisation, TC-10-09 + TC-10-20 strengthened, delete emit order). Round-4 confirmation pass 2026-04-28 verified all fixes landed cleanly with 0 surviving HIGH issues and 0 new contradictions. **Documentation set is implementation-ready for Phase 2.**
